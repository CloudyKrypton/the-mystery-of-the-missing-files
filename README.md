### Description
Mario and Steve are about to upload the final CSC258 results onto Acorn, when a travesty occurs--the files go missing! Solve CS related puzzles to progress through the mystery, and catch the culprit.

All of the characters in this game are CS professors at UofT that have taught me before! You might notice that I matched each professor to the room/building they taught me in, and also gave them a puzzle corresponding to the class they taught :)

Music used: sans. from Undertale
